#### **3. Design**

**3.1 System Architecture:**
- **Backend Architecture:**
  - **APIs:** RESTful APIs to handle data exchange between the mobile app and web portal.
  - **Database:** SQL/NoSQL database for storing content, user data, and feedback.
  - **Authentication:** OAuth2.0 or JWT for user authentication and authorization.
  - **Notification Service:** Push notification service using Firebase or a similar platform.
  - **Cloud Infrastructure:** AWS or Azure for hosting the application.

- **Frontend Architecture:**

  - **Mobile Application:**
    - Frameworks: React Native or Flutter for cross-platform mobile development.
    - UI/UX Design: Focus on intuitive design and accessibility features.

**3.2 Data Flow Diagrams:**
- **User Interaction Flow:** Outline how users (SME owners and admins) will interact with the application, detailing steps from login to accessing content and providing feedback.
- **Content Management Flow:** Detail how admins will create and manage content, and how this content is served to mobile app users.
- **Notification Flow:** Illustrate how notifications are triggered by admin actions and received by users.

**3.3 Database Design:**
- **Entities:**
  - **Users:** SME Owners, Admins
  - **Content:** Articles, Videos, Ads
  - **Locations:** Regions, Sub-locations
  - **Feedback:** User feedback and ratings
  - **Notifications:** Notification logs
- **Relationships:**
  - **Users** <-> **Locations:** Many-to-Many
